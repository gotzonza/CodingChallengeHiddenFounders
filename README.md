This "Demo", takes the Data from the GitHub API, and it inserts on a UITableView.

I used JSONDecoder, the new tool of Swift 4. Using this, is quite easy to GET API data, like repo name, owner name... etc. This has to be used with Decodable Structs.

Then, the second hardest tip, was to download the images and show in the table. This, I did it with an extension.
